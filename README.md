# Campus-CRUD-app
This was the final project of my Spring 2021 Web Development class. Me and my groupmates were supposed to use Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, in order to build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This would cover CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
